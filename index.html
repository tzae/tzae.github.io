        <h1>This is my motherfucking website.</h1>
        <aside>And it's (not) fucking perfect.</aside>
    </header>

        <h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>

        <p>You probably made a webpage with actual content, selling a product or sharing an idea, I am not doing anything with this because:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>I currently have no products to sell</li>
            <li>I currently have no services to sell</li>
            <li>I currently have no content to share</li>
            <li>I currently am unable to produce any kind of useful material</li>
            <li>I currently suck at doing nothing too!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>So guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

        <p>This website will lack substance, will look empty and a waste of github resources, and it is but at least it loads quickly and it's.. responsive</p>

    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p>The creator of <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">motherfuckingwebsite.com</a> had the brilliant idea to make a simple website generator so they made one and you can find it at  <a href="http://txti.es/">txti.es</a> and <a href="/txti-es.html">I made this with it</a>.</p>
